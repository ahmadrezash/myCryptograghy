They created a radical new design, the cavity magnetron, that made microwave radar possible. Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee, which reported in July , that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as . Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, developing electromagnetic isotope separation, which provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August .After the war, Oliphant returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University (ANU), where he initiated the design and construction of the worlds largest (500 megajoule) homopolar generator. He retired in, but was appointed Governor of South Australia on the advice of Premier, Don Dunstan. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in at which the party was launched. Late in life he watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in , and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in . '\n",
